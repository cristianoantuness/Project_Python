    "The COVID-19 pandemic had a major negative impact on the world’s economy in 2020 caused by major lockdowns (Gopinath, 2020). This led to supply and demand shocks and a ‘serious’ economic situation according to Minsch, Wehrli, & Salvi (2020, para 4.).\n",
    "The public transportation industry in Switzerland was confronted with a demand shock as soon as restrictions were put in place. Due to the public transportation’s nature of operating with non-storable tradeable services, an L-shaped growth evolution was predicted by Baldwin and Weder di Mauro (2020) in the early stages of the pandemic, which in retrospect proved to be true. Figure 1 depicts the major drop in total rail passengers that occurred at the beginning of the pandemic in Switzerland.\n"
