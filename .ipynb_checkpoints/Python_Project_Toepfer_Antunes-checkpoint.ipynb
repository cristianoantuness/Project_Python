    "<font size=\"4\"> <div style=\"text-align: justify\"> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The COVID-19 pandemic affected the world in many negative ways, due to the health hazards and major lockdowns imposed by governments. The resulted supply and demand shocks led to an overall serious economic situation. This also impacted the public transportation industry in Switzerland as soon as restrictions were put in place. Since the general public transportation industry operates with non-storable tradeable services, an L-shaped growth regression was predicted by Baldwin and Weder di Mauro (2020) at the early stages of the pandemic. Figure 1 proves said prediction by broadcasting a major drop in rail passengers at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland. </div> </font>"

A comparison to Austria was initially intended, as Switzerland and Austria share a similar landmasses and population sizes. However, there was no reliable data available for Austria’s public rail passenger transportation system. Therefore, a comparison to Sweden was chosen and depicted in Figure 2, since both countries share a similar GDP per capita and only a small difference in population size is evident. Neighboring countries such as Germany, Italy, and France have lower GDP per capita altogether and larger population sizes, making them less suitable for a comparison. <br /> <br /> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; At first sight, Figure 2 clearly shows that the Swiss rail passenger numbers decreased on a larger scale in relative terms compared to Sweden's. </div> </font>\n"

    "<font size=\"4\"> <div style=\"text-align: justify\"> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; At the beginning stages, we first had to spend quite some time studying all the lecture material before we could familiarize ourselves with GitHub, set up a GitHub Repo and finally start writing and coding our WAM69 Python Project in Jupyter Notebook. At that time, we wished we would have had more extensive knowledge about GitHub and working with datasets in Python prior to starting the project. Throughout the whole process of working on our project, we had to do an extensive amount of online research in order to be able to transfer our ideas into Python codes. Fortunately for us, there were more than enough sources available online to facilitate our ideas. \n",
    "For example, we struggled immensely with the process of reading, editing and plotting SPSS .sav files in Jupyter Notebook, until we found out that in order to import the missing module “pyreadstat”, an additional code that updates Pandas to version 1.4 was necessary beforehand. </div> </font>\n",

We looked forward to working with the theme and data surrounding rail transportation during the COVID-19 pandemic since we simultaneously worked with a similar topic in the ACM Economics Project module. In regard to group dynamics, it certainly helped that we, the authors, already knew each other and had already successfully worked together in the past. </div> </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=\"4\"> <div style=\"text-align: justify\"> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; In the end, we ultimately achieved our set goals and are proud of how our final work turned out to be. We are now able to benefit from new competencies acquired during the WAM69 Python module and hope the quality of this Python project (which deserves a 6 ;-) ) reflects that.\n",
